# An Online Human Evaluation Form Template

This online form template functions like [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) but is more customizable.
Please feel free to use this as a template to create your own online human evaluation form.

### Usage

1. Create a Google Spreadsheet and copy its ID from its URL:
    ```
    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID}/edit
    ```
2. Create a Google Apps Script from **app.gs** and fill in `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID` you just copied.
3. Customize the script to meet your need and deploy it as a Web App.
4. Customize **generate_form.py** and generate a form webpage.
5. (optional) Use GitHub Pages to host the online form webpage for you.
